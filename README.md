# react-mst-realworld-app
Real world application built with React and mobx-state-tree  

In this project I'm going to try some features that interest me:

- eslint + prettier
- husky + commitlint + lint-staged
- i18n
- a11y
- dark mode
- ssr?
- pwa?
- tests
- storybook?
- css critical path
- dynamic imports
- new React APIâ€™s (suspense, hooks, etc.)
- mobx-state-tree

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Next App](https://github.com/segmentio/create-next-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `.next` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run start`

Starts the application in production mode.
The application should be compiled with \`next build\` first.
